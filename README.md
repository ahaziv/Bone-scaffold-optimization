# Bone-scaffold-optimization
## Intro
The different codes  implement an optimization pipeline for biodegradable bone scaffolds. 
## System requirements
This project was built using different existing programs and is written in different API languages. While the simulation is written on MATLAB the optimization is written in python you will need several different licences in order to make it work:
* MATLAB - version 2019 or later.
* Python 3.7
* ANSYS workbench 2018 - API language - IronPython
* SpaceClaim 2018 (ANSYS add on) - API language - Python, Version R18
After making sure all of the above are set and ready, please create the following directory tree as shown in this repository.
Make sure as well to change the ANSYS installation file path in the python optimization functions to match the path of your system.
